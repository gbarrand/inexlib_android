  You have to setup your Android SDK and NDK development environment with :
    csh> source ../../../../../bush/setup/android-<version>.csh
   ( sh> . ../../../../../bush/setup/android-<version>.sh )

 When done, build and install with :
    UNIX> ./build
 
 NOTE : the jks password asked during the build to sign the .apk is 'android'.

  Obviously you need to have on your machine an Android SDK and NDK, and have
 the AndroidManifest.xml, [ant,local,project].properties, jni/Application.mk files
 tuned properly for these SDK/NDK and Android API. See the "Build for Android" section
 under the softinex portal for more
