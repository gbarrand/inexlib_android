  To build the exlib_gl Android app doing some simple GL-ES :
    UNIX> cd <install_path>/inexlib/exlib/examples/Android/gl
    UNIX> <read the README>
    UNIX> ./build

  To build the exlib_sg Android app drawing a cube with inlib/sg/cube (and GL-ES) :
    UNIX> cd <install_path>/inexlib/exlib/examples/Android/sg
    UNIX> <read the README>
    UNIX> ./build

  These builds assume a lot of prerequistes (for example having installed an
 Android SDK and NDK, etc). See also the "Build for Android" section under
 the softinex portal for generic instructions. When/if having these two little
 apps running on your Android device, you can attempt to build the pmx and/or
 the g4exa apps doing much more visualization in connection to physics.
